5.1.3 See ThreadPools.xlsx
5.1.4 I was quite surprised (and also doubting the correctness of the results) to see such a performance difference between CachedThreadPool and WorkStealingThreadPool. CachedThreadPool performs significantly better. The work is computed faster with more tasks and peaks on about 40 tasks. This might be that the work is divided better between the threads when using many tasks.
5.1.5 See CachedThreadPool_atomiclong.txt, WorkStealingThreadPool_atomiclong.txt and ThreadPools.xlsx
5.2.[1-4] See TestTaskTime.java
5.2.5 See TestTaskTime.txt. The results seams correct and plausible. It is fun to see that the newWorkStealingPool is here faster than the cahcedThreadPool. Also that there is such a large time difference when cancelling.
