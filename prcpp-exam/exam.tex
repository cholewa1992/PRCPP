\section{}
The output for \texttt{TestLocking0.java} clearly indicates that it is not thread-safe.
\begin{lstlisting}[language={}, frame={}]

Sum is 1505632.000000 and should be 2000000.000000

mac610262:src jbec$ java TestLocking0
Sum is 1505498.000000 and should be 2000000.000000
\end{lstlisting}

The actual sum deviates from the expected sum leading me to believe that a race condition occurs in the code.

\section{}
The problem is that while the \texttt{addInstance} method locks the object instance, \texttt{addStatic} locks the class. Hence the field \texttt{sum} is not guarded by the same lock. This allows for multiple threads to simultaneously access the \texttt{sum} variable, therefore not upholding mutual exclusion, causing the race condition.

\section{}
A simple solution is to change \texttt{addInstance} so that it is guarded by the class lock used by the static synchronized methods
\begin{lstlisting}[frame={}]
public void addInstance(double x) {
    synchronized(Mystery.class){
        sum += x;
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
This now ensures mutual exclusion as \texttt{sum} is now guarded by the same lock. Rerunning the code shows that the expected result and the actual result are now the same.

\section{}
The simplest way would be to make a synchronized version that guards \texttt{items} and \texttt{size} with an instance lock. This would ensure safe concurrent access to the arraylist.
\section{}\label{sec:lock}
While the n√§ive approach described above makes the arraylist threadsafe, it does not allow parallel access and thus doesn't scale. Actually I expect the synchronized version to perform significantly worse when used by many threads compared to only a single thread.
\section{}
A simple answer to why the purposed pattern is not threadsafe is found in the sample given in the assignment. The example clearly shows that both \texttt{add} and \texttt{set} accesses \texttt{items} and \texttt{size}. As the methods uses different locks, concurrent access to \texttt{items} and \texttt{size} can occur making it not threadsafe.

\moreFancyQuote{When thread $A$ executes a synchronized block, and subsequently thread $B$ enters a synchronized block guarded by the same lock, the values of variables that were visible to $A$ prior to releasing the lock are guaranteed to be visible to $B$ upon acquiring the lock.}{\citet[p. 37]{goetz2006java}}

However, because the methods uses different locks, visibility is not guaranteed.
\section{}
While it is possible that a version might exist that makes this threadsafe, it will still require mutual exclusion when at least writing to \texttt{items} and \texttt{size}. I don't see many other (simple) ways than to fully lock both \texttt{items} and \texttt{size} when accessed. Thus it won't make much sense to have a lock for the methods if we either way have to lock the only two shared fields. Then we could as well just only lock those instead.

\section{}
The \texttt{totalSize} field can be made threadsafe by either using an \texttt{AtomicInteger} or by having \texttt{totalSize} guarded by a static lock object. The following snippet shows how it would be implemented in the code using an \texttt{AtomicInteger}

\begin{lstlisting}[frame={}]
private static AtomicInteger totalSize = new AtomicInteger();

public boolean add(double x) {
    if (size == items.length) {
        ...
    }
    items[size] = x;
    size++;
    totalSize.incrementAndGet();
    return true;
}

public static int totalSize() {
    return totalSize.get();
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{}
The \texttt{allLists} field can be make threadsafe by guarding it with a static lock object. It can be implemented in code in following way.
\begin{lstlisting}[frame={}]
private static HashSet<DoubleArrayList> allLists = new HashSet<>();
private static Object ListsLock = new Object();

public DoubleArrayList() {
    synchronized(ListsLock){
        allLists.add(this);
    }
}

public static HashSet<DoubleArrayList> allLists() {
    synchronized(ListsLock){
        return allLists;
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
